## What this covers

Four allocation paths tested against the **real Atlas DB** (`.env`):

| Path | Groups | Method / Function | Description |
|------|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| AGRI_EXPERT | G1–G2 | `POST /api/questions` (source=`AGRI_EXPERT`) | Creates question → `setImmediate` kicks off background expert assignment |
| OUTREACH | G3 | `POST /api/questions` (source=`OUTREACH`) | Creates question — queue stays empty; no background allocation |
| Toggle | G4 | `PATCH /api/questions/:id/toggle-auto-allocate` | Moderator flips flag; OFF→ON calls `autoAllocateExperts` synchronously |
| Time-bound cron | G5–G10 | `questionService.reallocateTimeBoundQuestions()` | Cron (every 2 min in prod) assigns STF experts to WHATSAPP/AJRASAKHA questions |
| Reviewer-stage guard | G11 | `questionService.reallocateTimeBoundQuestions()` | Cron does not re-process a question already in the reviewer stage |
| Toggle sequential | G12 | `PATCH /api/questions/:id/toggle-auto-allocate` | ON→OFF→ON on the same question — no duplicate experts, queue preserved on OFF |

**Questions excluded from the unallocated time-bound query (G7 negative cases):**

| Condition | Why excluded |
|-----------|-------------|
| `isAutoAllocate=false` | filter requires `isAutoAllocate=true` |
| `isOnHold=true` | filter excludes on-hold questions |
| `status='closed'` | only `open/delayed/duplicate` eligible |
| `status='non_agri'` | only `open/delayed/duplicate` eligible |
| `source='OUTREACH'` | source must be `WHATSAPP` or `AJRASAKHA` |
| `source='AGRI_EXPERT'` | source must be `WHATSAPP` or `AJRASAKHA` |
| `queue` non-empty | filter requires `queue.size=0` |

## Key differences at a glance

| Dimension | AGRI_EXPERT | OUTREACH | Toggle | Time-bound cron |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Source** | `AGRI_EXPERT` | `OUTREACH` | Any | `WHATSAPP`, `AJRASAKHA` |
| **Trigger** | `setImmediate` at creation | — | `PATCH` endpoint | Cron every 2 min |
| **Expert selection** | `findExpertsByPreference` (score + workload) | N/A | Same as AGRI_EXPERT | `findExpertsByReputationScore` (workload only) |
| **STF required?** | No | N/A | No | YES — initial only. No for reviewer |
| **MAX active cap** | No | N/A | No | 1 per expert (`MAX_TIME_BOUND`) |
| **Queue size** | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 initially; grows as reviewers added |
| **Async?** | Yes (`setImmediate`) — tests poll | N/A | No — synchronous | No — awaited directly |
| **Notification** | `answer_creation` | None | `answer_creation` | `answer_creation` / `peer_review` (reviewer) |

---

## Strategy

**In-process server** — `loadAppModules('all')` builds the real production DI container against
the real Atlas DB. Users are fetched from the DB by email using `.env.test` credentials.
A `currentTestUser` variable is swapped per test; both `authorizationChecker` and
`currentUserChecker` read from it.

`InternalApiAuth` is a global `@Middleware({ type: 'before' })` that checks `x-internal-api-key`
on every route. The test sets `process.env.INTERNAL_API_KEY = 'e2e-auto-alloc-key'` and attaches
that header to all requests via `apiPost`/`apiPatch` helpers.

**Polling:** AGRI_EXPERT background processing runs via `setImmediate`, so the submission queue
is populated asynchronously. Tests poll every 300 ms (up to 10 s) using `pollUntil()`.

**Toggle is synchronous:** `toggleAutoAllocate` awaits `autoAllocateExperts` directly — no polling needed.

**Time-bound is synchronous:** `reallocateTimeBoundQuestions()` is awaited directly. The cron
wrapper is gated by `if (!appConfig.isDevelopment)` and never fires when `NODE_ENV=development`.

**STF auto-promotion:** `beforeAll` checks how many experts have `special_task_force=true`. If
fewer than 3, it promotes the shortfall number of non-STF experts (lowest `reputation_score` first)
via a `$set` update so Groups 5–8 and 13–14 always have enough STF experts to run. Groups 5, 6, 8,
13, and 14 guard with `if (stfExperts.length < 2) return;` as a last-resort fallback.

---

## Test setup

- `.env` loaded first → real Atlas DB URL / DB_NAME
- `.env.test` loaded second (dotenv does NOT override existing vars) → test user credentials
- `process.env.NODE_ENV = 'development'` set before any module load → Atlas TLS stays enabled
- AnswerService warm-up import before `loadAppModules` → circular-import workaround
- AiService dummied via `container.rebindSync(CORE_TYPES.AIService)`
- `questionService = container.get(CORE_TYPES.QuestionService)` fetched in `beforeAll`
- **STF auto-promotion:** if fewer than 3 experts have `special_task_force=true`, the shortfall is
  promoted via `users.updateMany(...)` before tests run (lowest `reputation_score` first, so
  preference-scoring test #5 is not disturbed)
- **Leftover cleanup (two passes):**
  1. Closes questions with STF expert already in queue (status `open`/`delayed`) — these make `getTimeBoundActiveCountPerExpert` count them as active even before our test seeds run.
  2. Closes unallocated (`queue=[]`) WHATSAPP/AJRASAKHA questions with `isAutoAllocate=true` from previous incomplete runs — these would consume the STF expert's capacity during the cron run before our question is processed.
  Both sets are tracked in `temporarilyClosedIds` and restored to `status='open'` in `afterAll`.
- **Per-group afterAlls (G5, G6, G8, G13):** After each time-bound group's tests complete, its seeded question is set to `status='closed'`, freeing the STF expert's capacity for the next group's cron run. G13's afterAll closes the stuck question so the same STF expert is free for G14.
- STF experts fetched after promotion and cleanup:
  `users.find({ role: 'expert', isBlocked: false, special_task_force: true })`

---

## Cleanup (afterAll)

Removes from the real DB (keyed on `createdQuestionIds`):
- `questions`
- `question_submissions`
- `notifications`

Restores any questions that were temporarily closed in `beforeAll` to `status: 'open'`
(keyed on `temporarilyClosedIds`).

`reputation_score` increments are NOT reversed — acceptable in the test DB.

## Test cases (54 total)

### Group 1 — AGRI_EXPERT background allocation (4 tests)

| # | What | Expected |
|---|------|----------|
| 1 | Question is immediately open with `isAutoAllocate=true` | `status='open'`, `isAutoAllocate=true` |
| 2 | Background process populates queue with exactly 1 expert | `queue.length === 1` (after `pollUntil`) |
| 3 | `firstAllocationAt` stamped after background runs | `instanceof Date` |
| 4 | `answer_creation` notification sent to `queue[0]` | notif found in DB |

### Group 2 — AGRI_EXPERT preference scoring (1 test)

| # | What | Expected |
|---|------|----------|
| 5 | `queue[0]` is `experttest1` (Punjab + Crop Protection + Brinjal = 6 pts) | `queue[0] === expertUser1._id` |

### Group 3 — OUTREACH: no background allocation (3 tests)

| # | What | Expected |
|---|------|----------|
| 6 | Question open with `isAutoAllocate=true` | `status='open'`, `isAutoAllocate=true` |
| 7 | Queue empty immediately after creation | `queue.length === 0` |
| 8 | Queue still empty after 1 s wait | `queue.length === 0` |

### Group 4 — Toggle auto-allocate (3 tests)

| # | What | Expected |
|---|------|----------|
| 9 | No user → 401 | `res.status === 401` |
| 10 | OFF→ON: flag flips, queue filled synchronously | `200`, `isAutoAllocate=true`, `queue.length >= 1` |
| 11 | ON→OFF: flag flips, queue untouched | `200`, `isAutoAllocate=false`, queue unchanged |

### Group 5 — WHATSAPP time-bound initial allocation (7 tests)

*`beforeAll` auto-promotes experts to STF so this normally runs. Self-skips only if promotion itself finds no eligible experts.*

| # | What | Expected |
|---|------|----------|
| 12 | `reallocateTimeBoundQuestions()` reports `reallocated >= 1` | ✓ |
| 13 | Queue has exactly 1 expert | `queue.length === 1` |
| 14 | Allocated expert has `special_task_force=true` | STF requirement enforced |
| 15 | `question.firstAllocationAt` stamped | `instanceof Date` |
| 16 | `submission.currentExpertAllocatedAt` set | `instanceof Date` |
| 17 | `answer_creation` notification sent to allocated expert | notif found |
| 55 | `firstAllocationAt` and `currentExpertAllocatedAt` differ by < 60 s (Issue #9) | `deltaMs < 60_000` |

### Group 6 — AJRASAKHA time-bound initial allocation (4 tests)

*Same pipeline as WHATSAPP — different source label. Self-skips only if STF promotion fails.*

| # | What | Expected |
|---|------|----------|
| 18 | `reallocateTimeBoundQuestions()` reports `reallocated >= 1` | ✓ |
| 19 | Queue has 1 STF expert | `queue.length === 1`, `expert.special_task_force === true` |
| 20 | Notification message mentions "Ajrasakha" | `notif.message` matches `/ajrasakha/i` |
| 21 | `firstAllocationAt` stamped | `instanceof Date` |

### Group 7 — Negative cases: questions NOT picked up (7 tests)

| # | Seed condition | Expected |
|---|---------------|----------|
| 22 | `isAutoAllocate=false` WHATSAPP | queue stays empty |
| 23 | `isOnHold=true` WHATSAPP | queue stays empty |
| 24 | `status='closed'` WHATSAPP | queue stays empty |
| 25 | `status='non_agri'` WHATSAPP | queue stays empty |
| 26 | `source='OUTREACH'` | queue stays empty |
| 27 | `source='AGRI_EXPERT'` | queue stays empty |
| 28 | Already allocated (non-empty queue) | queue unchanged at 1 expert |

### Group 8 — MAX_TIME_BOUND=1 capacity enforcement (3 tests)

*Self-skips only if STF promotion fails. Tests #30 and #31 are mutually exclusive on `stfExperts.length`.*

| # | What | Expected |
|---|------|----------|
| 29 | Busy STF expert NOT assigned to the new question | `queue[0] ≠ busyExpert._id` |
| 30 | Only 1 STF expert (now busy) → new question skipped | `queue=[]`, `skipped >= 1` |
| 31 | 2+ STF experts → new question goes to a different free one | `queue=[differentExpert]` |

### Group 11 — Reviewer-stage question not re-processed by cron (3 tests)

*Guards against the cron resetting or extending the queue when a reviewer is already mid-review.*

| # | What | Expected |
|---|------|----------|
| 39 | Queue still has exactly 2 members after cron run | `queue.length === 2` |
| 40 | `queue[0]` is still the original author | unchanged |
| 41 | `queue[1]` is still the original reviewer — no third expert added | unchanged |

### Group 12 — Toggle sequential ON → OFF → ON same question (3 tests)

*Documents toggle semantics and guards against unbounded queue growth on repeated flips.*

| # | What | Expected |
|---|------|----------|
| 42 | OFF→ON: `isAutoAllocate=true`, queue populated with 1 expert | `queue.length >= 1` |
| 43 | ON→OFF: `isAutoAllocate=false`, queue length preserved (not cleared) | queue same length as after ON |
| 44 | Second OFF→ON: no duplicate expert IDs in queue | all IDs unique |

### Group 13 — Stuck question (>45 min, never opened) (5 tests)

*`startBalanceWorkloadWorkers` is mocked — verifies detection + expert selection, not worker DB writes. Self-skips if fewer than 2 STF experts.*

| # | What | Expected |
|---|------|----------|
| 45 | `reallocateTimeBoundQuestions()` reports `reallocated >= 1` | stuck question detected |
| 46 | `startBalanceWorkloadWorkers` was called | worker path triggered |
| 47 | Worker assignment for our submission has `appendExpert=false` | replacement (not append) |
| 48 | `skipPenalty` is falsy — stuck expert IS penalised | `skipPenalty === false` |
| 49 | Replacement expert is STF and not the stuck expert | `special_task_force=true`, different ID |

### Group 14 — Opened-but-idle question (>45 min, no answer) (5 tests)

*Same worker mock as G13. Key difference: `skipPenalty=true` — idle expert is freed but not penalised. Self-skips if fewer than 2 STF experts.*

| # | What | Expected |
|---|------|----------|
| 50 | `reallocateTimeBoundQuestions()` reports `reallocated >= 1` | idle question detected |
| 51 | `startBalanceWorkloadWorkers` was called | worker path triggered |
| 52 | Worker assignment for our submission has `appendExpert=false` | replacement (not append) |
| 53 | `skipPenalty=true` — idle expert NOT penalised | `skipPenalty === true` |
| 54 | Replacement expert is different from the idle expert | different ID |

### Group 9 — Concurrent run guard (1 test)

| # | What | Expected |
|---|------|----------|
| 32 | Second call (before first `await`) returns early | `message === 'Reallocation already in progress'`, `reallocated=0`, `skipped=0` |

### Group 10 — Reviewer assignment (6 tests)

| # | What | Expected |
|---|------|----------|
| 33 | `reallocateTimeBoundQuestions()` reports `reallocated >= 1` | ✓ |
| 34 | Queue grows from 1 to 2 | `queue.length === 2` |
| 35 | Reviewer is a different expert from the author | `queue[1] ≠ expertUser1._id` |
| 36 | History has new `in-review` entry for reviewer | `history.length === 2`, `history[1].status === 'in-review'` |
| 37 | `peer_review` notification sent to reviewer | notif found in DB |
| 38 | `currentExpertAllocatedAt` reset, `currentExpertOpenedAt` cleared to `null` | both updated |

---

## Critical constraints

### STF-only for initial time-bound allocation

```ts
for (const expert of allExperts) {
  if (expert?.special_task_force !== true) continue;  // ← STF ONLY
```

If no STF expert has capacity, the question is **skipped indefinitely**. Likely root cause of
WHATSAPP/AJRASAKHA questions not getting allocated in production.

### MAX_TIME_BOUND = 1

Each expert holds at most 1 active time-bound question. "Active" = in queue with no answer yet,
or in queue with `history[n].status === 'in-review'`.

### Reviewer has no STF requirement

`assignTimeBoundReviewer` selects any free expert — not STF-gated.

### Concurrent guard fires synchronously

`isReallocatingTimeBound = true` is set **before** the first `await`, so a second call fired
immediately always sees it as `true`.

### Cron does not run in development

`timeBoundReAllocateCron.ts` is gated by `if (!appConfig.isDevelopment)` — never fires in tests.

### Stuck/idle branches spawn worker threads (mocked in tests)

`startBalanceWorkloadWorkers()` normally targets `build/workers/balanceWorkload.worker.js`
and spawns Node Worker threads for parallel DB writes. In tests, this module is replaced by
a `vi.mock()` that returns `{ processed: 1, failedWorkers: 0 }` immediately, so no Worker
thread is spawned. G13 (stuck) and G14 (idle) verify that `reallocateTimeBoundQuestions()`
correctly **detects** the question, **selects** the replacement expert (STF-gated, capacity-aware),
and **builds** the right `flatAssignments` entry (correct `skipPenalty` flag). The worker's
actual DB queue-swap and penalty writes are not re-exercised here.

---

## Known assumption: preference test (#5)

Asserts `experttest1` is allocated for `state=Punjab, domain=Crop Protection, crop=Brinjal`
(6-point score). Non-deterministic if another expert also scores 6 points — shuffle within tiers.

## Last Test Run Results

**Pre-fix run (2026-06-15):** 33 passed, 11 failed.  
**Fixes applied (2026-06-16):**
- Added `afterAll` inside G5, G6, G8 to close their seeded questions after each group's tests complete, freeing the STF expert before the next group's cron run.
- Extended `beforeAll` cleanup to also close pre-existing unallocated WHATSAPP/AJRASAKHA questions (not just ones with STF experts already in queue).
- Reordered G9/G10 to appear before G11/G12 in the source file (cosmetic; matches the documented group order).
- Converted `ChemicalCrud.e2e.test.ts` and `QuestionCreate.e2e.test.ts` from the old external-server (`localhost:4000` + Firebase) pattern to the standard in-process harness.
- Fixed group ordering in `PostAllocation.e2e.test.ts` (Group 7 before Group 8).

**Actual result (2026-06-16):** 36 passed, 8 failed. G5–G12 fixes worked as intended.
G1–G3 regressed due to a new bug in `addQuestion` (unrelated to this fix).

**G1–G3:** Expected 201 from `POST /api/questions`, got 400 (`"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data')"`) for all sources (AGRI_EXPERT and OUTREACH). Same failure as WhatsApp, Ajrasakha, and QuestionCreate suites. G4–G12 seed questions directly into the DB and are unaffected.

## Known Service Bug (not a test bug)

### AGRI_EXPERT `answer_creation` notification not sent (test #4)

Path: `A5 → A6`. `firstAllocationAt` IS stamped (test #3 passes) and queue IS populated (test #2 passes), but the `answer_creation` notification is not created in the DB.

Root cause: `processQuestionInBackground` allocates the expert and stamps timestamps, but the notification write (`NotificationService.addNotification` or similar) is either silently throwing or the notification type/userId lookup is failing. This is a bug in the service, not in the test harness.
