# Post-Allocation Review Workflow — E2E Test Flow

Covers `PostAllocation.e2e.test.ts` (**24 tests**). This suite begins where
allocation ends — a question whose submission already has a populated `queue`
(manual allocation → `ManualAllocation.e2e.test.ts`, auto allocation →
`QuestionAutoAllocation.e2e.test.ts`) — and drives it through the full
expert peer-review → moderator-approval state machine.

## The reviewAnswer error-mapping quirk (KNOWN)

`AnswerService.reviewAnswer` wraps its **entire** body in a `try/catch` and
rethrows every error as `InternalServerError`. The controller then re-throws
`InternalServerError` as HTTP **500**. So *every* failure inside the peer-review
endpoint (wrong role, wrong reviewer, duplicate submission, identical-answer
guard, closed question…) surfaces as **500** — never 400/401/403.

`approveAnswer` (PUT `/answers`) does **not** have this quirk: its role/state
guards correctly surface as **400**.

These are pinned as expected results in the suite and flagged `KNOWN`.

## Last Test Run Results

### 2026-06-16

**Total:** 27 tests — **25 passed, 2 failed**

Significant improvement over 2026-06-15 (20 passed → 25 passed). The reviewer-rejection
timeout (#13) and its cascades (#14) are resolved. One pre-existing failure (first-answer
timeout #4) persists, and one new regression appeared in the normalised_crop edge case (#19).

| **4** | **e1 (queue[0]) submits first answer → in-review, e2 assigned** | ❌ **FAIL** | **Timeout 5009ms** — answer IS saved (server completes the write), but response exceeds the 5 s vitest timeout |
| 5 | e1 submits again → 500 (KNOWN: already submitted) | ✅ | Passes because #4's write completed despite timeout |
| 6 | e2 accepts → approvalCount 1, e3 assigned | ✅ | — |

| 18 | Approve when question still open → 400 | ✅ | — |
| **19** | **Approve with no normalised_crop → 400** | ❌ **FAIL** | **2030ms — NEW regression**: returned non-400 status; previously passed |
| 20 | LLM approve with non AJRASAKHA/WHATSAPP source → 400 | ✅ | — |
| 21 | Edit finalised answer on closed question → 200 | ✅ | — |
| 22 | PAE expert submits → `pae_submitted` | ✅ | — |
| 23 | Moderator approves `pae_submitted` → closed | ✅ | — |
| 24 | Delete non-final answer → removed, count decremented | ✅ | — |
| 25 | approvalCount=1: question still `'open'` | ✅ | — |
| 26 | approvalCount=2: question still `'open'` (not `'in-review'`) | ✅ | — |
| 27 | approvalCount=2: no `moderator_approval` notification sent | ✅ | — |

**Open issues (2026-06-16):**

**Test #4 (first-answer timeout):** `handleFirstSubmission` exceeds 5 s. The write completes
server-side (downstream tests pass), so this is likely a slow notification dispatch or push
notification lookup (`No subscription found for user …` appears in stderr). Investigate
`AnswerService.handleFirstSubmission` for blocking awaits on notification paths.

**Test #19 (normalised_crop regression):** `POST /answers/moderator/approve` no longer returns 400
when `question.normalised_crop` is absent. A recent commit (`fix #819` navigation, `fix #814`
account sync) may have altered the crop-normalisation guard in `approveAnswer`. Investigate
`AnswerService.approveAnswer` validation of `normalised_crop`.

## Failing Paths (2026-06-15)

### 1. e1 first-answer submission times out (test #4) — cascades to tests #6-8 and #10

`POST /answers/review` (no status, first submission) hangs and never returns within 5000ms.
Tests #6, #7, #8 subsequently receive **400** (the question's submission state wasn't updated
so e2/e3/e4 are not recognised as the next reviewer) and #10 receives **400** (question never
reached `in-review` status so `approveAnswer` rejects it).

The fact that the modify path (test #16, uses the same endpoint with `status='modified'`) passes
suggests the timeout is specific to the **first-submission branch** (no `status` field, goes
through `handleFirstSubmission`). Investigate `AnswerService.reviewAnswer` → `handleFirstSubmission`
for a hanging await (DB call, AI call, notification write, etc.).

### 2. Reviewer rejection times out (test #13) — cascades to test #14

`POST /answers/review` with `status='rejected'` also hangs.
Notification for `review_rejected` is `null` (test #14) because the submission never completed.
The rejection branch uses `handleReviewerRejection` — investigate that path for a hanging await.
Note: the modify path (`handleReviewerModification`) works fine (test #16 passes), isolating
the timeout to `handleFirstSubmission` and `handleReviewerRejection` specifically.

## How to run

```bash
# From backend/  (~19 s against the real Atlas DB in .env)
pnpm exec vitest run src/e2e/post-allocation/PostAllocation.e2e.test.ts
```

The suite seeds every question it needs (tagged `E2E_PA_<ts>`) and deletes all
seeded questions, submissions, answers, reviews and notifications in `afterAll`.
